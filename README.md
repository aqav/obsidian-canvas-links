The plugin adds views to show "outgoing links" and "backlinks" of canvas in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Enable the plugin and select the command starts with `Canvas Links:`.

- Register a view to show "outgoing links" of the canvas (**Which files the active canvas contains**)

- Support all filetype that [Obsidian accepted](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Accepted+file+formats)
